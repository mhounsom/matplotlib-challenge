In this assignment, we are utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib with Jupyter Notebook to create data tables and graphs for data that pertains to cancer drug testing with mice.

To access the code with the tables, graphs, and conclusions from the data, please click on the "Pymaceuticals" folder and then open the "pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb" file. To properly run the code on the file, you can download it and open it up on Jupyter Notebook.
